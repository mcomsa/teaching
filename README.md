## Multilevel Modeling (Frequentist and Bayesian)

This course was taught together with Peter Selb in summer semester 2018 and with Susumu Shikano in summer semester 2019 at the University of Konstanz. The latest scripts are:

* [R Primer](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/saschagobel/teaching/blob/master/scripts/r-primer.html): This script includes a very basic introduction to R. It covers how to obtain, install, and set up R and RStudio, learning the building blocks of the R language, and the basics of working with packages and data.
* [Frequentist Multilevel Modeling in R I](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/saschagobel/teaching/blob/master/scripts/frequentist-i.html): Fitting, evaluating, and interpreting frequentist linear multilevel models are covered in this script. It introduces lme4 and illustrates by gradually building up from varying-intercept models without predictors to varying-intercept and -slope models with individual- and group-level predictors.
* [Frequentist Multilevel Modeling in R II](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/saschagobel/teaching/blob/master/scripts/frequentist-ii.html): This script is structured as Frequentist Multilevel Modeling in R I but focuses on generalized linear models.
* [Bayesian Multilevel Modeling in R](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/saschagobel/teaching/blob/master/scripts/bayesian.html): Stan is introduced for Bayesian multilevel modeling in this script. It shows how to set up, fit, evaluate, and interpret linear and generalized linear multilevel models.
* [Postestimation for Multilevel Modeling in R](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/saschagobel/teaching/blob/master/scripts/postestimation.html): In this script the focus is on quantifying uncertainty of estimates via statistical simultation for frequentist and via the posterior for bayesian multilevel models. It further shows how to generate population-averaged predictions (aka average marginal effects, observed case approach, average predictive comparisons, or average partial effects) for both frequentist and bayesian multilevel models using a custom R function (available [here](https://github.com/saschagobel/teaching/blob/master/functions/mlAMEs.R)).
